# Personal-Porfolio-Cutdown



#### important disclosure for whom would grade this challenge.
---
This is a stripped down version (without js libraries and js) of my Personal-Portfolio linked below. The original repo uses libraries and frameworks that would be inappropriate for this challenge, so I am rewrote all css rules from Bootstrap (Model Design Bootstrap), and removing all self-written and library/framework APIs used. I was told and also decided that this is better for grading because the class has yet to cover javascript and APIs, but I wanted this repo to be reusable as a professional porfolio for résumé, so I wanted to include some JS knowledge I have prior.

original repo I wrote for this assignment: https://github.com/DanTheDev-zsh/Personal-Portfolio
